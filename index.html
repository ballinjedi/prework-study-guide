        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML elements are a type of content on a webpage. Most commonly, they include: text, image, header and list elements.</li>
          <li>Common elements used to divide and describe a page include: Meta-related elements, content division elements and semantic elements.</li>
          <li>Each HTML element is composed of an opening and closing tag "<>"</li>
          <li>At the top of an HTML document, you will see "!DOCTYPE html". That is a declaration that tells the browser what type of document it should expect when opened. In this case, HTML.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The head element contains the following three elements: charset, which sets the character encoding; http-equiv, which sets an HTTP header for content; and viewport, which sets the default view for the webpage.</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for the webpage.</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with the webpage.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for the webpage.</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, descriptions, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A css rule contains a selector, which defines the element or attributes to which the rules or declarations will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations in a CSS rule contains two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project. <a href="https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf">Git command cheatsheet</a> </a></li>
          <li>Repositories (or repos) are used as folders to store the following: files that contain code, files that contain other information about the code (e.g. a README file), and the version history for all files of the repo.</li>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is the tool that takes a static HTML/CSS webpage and makes it interactive (such as clicking a button, retreiving data or filling out a form).</li>
          <li>A JavaScript variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code. In JavaScript, we use the "var"" keyword.</li>
          <li>After the var keyword, we give the variable a name and it must be unique because it is how we will reference the information stored in the variable in our code.</li>
          <li>Lastly, an assignment operator is used "=". This assigns specific data that we want stored in our variable.</li>
          <li>Connecting JavaScript is similar to CSS but it is a script that is placed on the bottom under the footer element.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer excutes code in a script. In JavaScript, the code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last at the bottom. Switching the order of scripts will cause an undefined message in the console.</li>
          <li>Control flow can be interrupted with conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed or even if it is to be executed at all.</li>
          <li>If statements is a way of introducing decision-making into the code. When a computer encounters it, it will check to see if the condition provided is "truthy" and if it is, it will complete the action asked. If it isn't "Truthy" then it will ignore whatever is in between the curly brackets and move on.</li>
          <li>An example of truthy statements include True, null and 0 are false.</li>
          <li>"Else if" is used if there is more than one condition.</li>
          <li>=== is a strict equality operator which checks to see if two values are equal and then returns a boolean result True if the values are equal. It would return false if they are not equal.</li>
          <li>An "Array" is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way. To create an Array, a variable needs to be declared with only one data item (use var and give it a name). But instead of assigning a variable to a single value, we assign it to a group of values. It is important to note that not all Arrays must have multiple data types.</li>
          <li>Indices start with the number 0, not 1, and increase by 1 each time (0,1,2,3,4)</li>
          <li>For loops allow for a task to be performed on each piece of data using few lines of code.</li>
