# Newbie's Coding Study Guide

## Description

This web application is a continuous work in progress as it is my study guide for coding. It is meant to serve as a point where I can look back and use as a study guide(maybe at some point, you can as well). I hope this study guide will be helpful as it contains tips and definitions of coding concepts and how-to's. The hope is also that the web app will also reflect on my learning as I go through bootcamp.


## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use the study guide, you can review the notes in each section. If want to know what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics I learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
